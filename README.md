#📌 Project Overview

This project analyses manufacturing defect data to identify key cost drivers, defect patterns, and quality risks across products, inspection methods and defect severity.

The dashboard is designed to support quality and operations decision-making by focusing on the financial impact of defects rather than only defect volume.

The main goal is to help stakeholders quickly understand:

where defects occur,

which defects are most expensive,

and how defect trends evolve over time.

#⭐ North Star Metric

Total Repair Cost

This metric represents the overall business impact of manufacturing defects and is used as the primary performance indicator throughout the dashboard.

#📈 Key KPIs

Total Repair Cost

Total Defects

Average Repair Cost per Defect

Critical Defect Percentage

#📊 Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:

Trend analysis of defects over time (monthly)

Cost impact by defect type

Repair cost distribution by severity

Defects by inspection method and severity

Heatmap of defect location vs repair cost band

Interactive KPI cards

#🎯 Key Business Questions Answered

Which defect types contribute most to total repair cost?

Are critical defects significantly more expensive than minor defects?

How do defect volumes change over time?

Which inspection methods identify the most severe defects?

Which product locations are associated with high-cost repairs?

#🧠 Interactivity & Advanced Features

#🛠 Tools & Technologies

Tableau Public

Public dataset from Kaggle – Manufacturing Defects Dataset

Calculated fields and parameters created directly within Tableau

#📂 Dataset Description

Each record represents a detected defect with the following attributes:

Defect ID

Product ID

Defect type

Defect date

Defect location

Severity level

Inspection method

Repair cost

The dataset contains approximately 1,000 defect records.

#⚠️ Notes

This dataset is a public, synthetic dataset used for analytical and visualisation practice.
The focus of this project is on dashboard design, KPI definition, interactivity and business-oriented storytelling.
